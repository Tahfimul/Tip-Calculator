# Tip-Calculator
Simple and Fun project to calculate tips. It takes as input the amount of a check and the number of people splitting the check. Then, produces as output both the amount of tip and the total amount each person should pay for a 15%, 20%, and 25% tip. Output values must be computed assuming that the check is split evenly and must be rounded to the nearest integer.
